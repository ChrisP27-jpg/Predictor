# Predictor

This program recognizes patterns and determines if the next entered value will be true or not true. The user gives it an input file of hexadecimal numbers followed by T (true) or NT (not true), then followed again by another hexadecimal number. I have provided an example of what the input looks like.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./predictor "input file" "output file"
